# Style Transfer + Model Distillation (TensorFlow/Keras)

This project implements **Neural Style Transfer** using a VGG19-based teacher model and distills it into a lightweight CNN-based student model. The goal is to achieve high-quality artistic transformation with real-time performance.

## Features
- VGG19-based style transfer (Gatys et al.)
- Teacher dataset generator from style/content pairs
- Lightweight student model (Johnson-style CNN)
- Ready for deployment
- Clean modular code (TensorFlow 2.x)
